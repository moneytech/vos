#### Goals

- Keep it simple and easy to understand.
- Write it in V as much as possible.
- Target modern 64-bit architectures (amd64, aarch64, risc-v).

#### Why?

- Explore V capabilities in bare metal programming.
- Break the compiler as much as possible.
- Build a minimal and useful platform for software [especially written in V :^)], allowing for better control, isolation and smaller attack surface on VMs.
- Build a simple OS for low cost ARM/RISC-V boards that usually run Linux.
